This release contains 12 prototypes and two accompanying NAND dumps from where they were dumped from.

Unit AAA00000018 (X1B board), provided and dumped by March42 contained the following three applications:

- 4e43414d - NCAM - Camera Demo (May 28 2010)
- 43564743 - CVGC - Shader Test
- 4f43434c - OCCL - Shader Test

These prototypes target an incredibly early firmware, and as such cannot be emulated at this time. Instructions to run them have been provided as a part of the release.

Face Ace (Face Raiders) and Target Shooting (AR Games) became pack-in titles for the Nintendo 3DS, while the rest are demos created specifically for showcasing the 3DS at E3 2010, and have never been seen in full before today.
The other titles are development tools and samples used during the development of the console, and test various features of the system.

During the preparation of this release, we have created a spreadsheet documenting all of the 3DS's known E3 2010 demos, which you can find here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iD3ehrUs9kqwKzfiRq3IdhC1Ktr8nuEQ/view

If you're interested in seeing SVC differences for kernel 0.243.0, the kernel used in Unit 118, there is documentation available here: https://gist.github.com/TuxSH/adb21e0e4e7737ab28197d077ac469a7
